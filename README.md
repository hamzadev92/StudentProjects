# ♟ C++ Chess Game (OOP-Based)

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a console-based chess game implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It demonstrates key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The game supports two-player functionality and enforces basic chess rules and movements.

## 🚀 Features
- Full 8x8 chessboard rendered in the console
- Object-oriented design with classes like Piece, Board, Game, and individual piece types (Pawn, Rook, Knight, etc.)
- Movement validation for all standard pieces
- Turn-based gameplay for two players
- Basic check detection (optional extension in progress)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
- Compiler: g++ / any standard C++ compiler
